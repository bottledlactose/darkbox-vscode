# Darkbox Theme

A simplistic and distraction-free color theme based on the retro-style Gruvbox Vim and Neovim theme for Visual Studio Code, including syntax highlighting and workbench and terminal colors.

Alternatively, you may install the theme by downloading the VSIX file through the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/bottledlactose/darkbox-vscode/releases) by using the following command:
